# Soflan Runtime Reference

This reference summarizes the current Soflan support model. Prefer live repository docs and code when available.

## Scope

Soflan is a visual timeline speed system implemented as a MonoMod patch. It reads MA2 `SFL` rows into `SoflanManager`, then uses the Soflan time axis to drive note visibility, Y position, scaling, and selected original animations. It does not change audio playback or judgment timing.

The runtime depends on `SimpleSoflanFramework.Core`:

- `SoflanListMap`: multiple Soflan lists keyed by group.
- `BpmList`: chart BPM changes.
- `TGridCalculator`: conversion between audio time, `TGrid`, and Soflan Y.

## MA2 SFL Rows

Runtime consumes MA2 rows that begin with `SFL`.

```text
SFL    grid    unit    length    speed    group
```

Fields:

| Field | Index | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `SFL` | 0 | Row type, case-insensitive |
| `grid` | 1 | Start `TGrid` grid |
| `unit` | 2 | Start `TGrid` unit |
| `length` | 3 | Duration, applied as `GridOffset(0, length)` |
| `speed` | 4 | Visual timeline multiplier |
| `group` | 5 | Soflan group; empty means `0` |

Runtime object shape:

```csharp
new Soflan
{
    TGrid = new TGrid(grid, unit),
    EndTGrid = TGrid + new GridOffset(0, length),
    Speed = speed,
    SoflanGroup = groupOrZero
}
```

`speed = 1` is normal visual speed, `speed = 0` is stop, and negative speed reverses the visual timeline. Current parsing logs `parse soflan failed` and stops reading later `SFL` rows when a row cannot be parsed.

## Note Markers

Note records can include one Soflan marker beginning with `#`.

```text
#0
#1
#219
```

Meaning:

- `#N` assigns that note to Soflan group `N`.
- Missing marker means group `0`.
- Multiple `#...` markers on one note are invalid.
- The marker is a patch extension scanned by `SoflanManager.loadNote()` from `record._str`; it is not an original game API.

## FixedSoflan Markers

FixedSoflan appends `F` or `f` after the group.

```text
#1F
#1F600
#F
#F750
```

Rules:

- `#1F` is equivalent to `#1F600`.
- `#F` is group `0` with fixed speed `600`.
- Speeds use invariant-culture float parsing and must be positive.
- Marker errors log and throw `FormatException`.
- FixedSoflan is per note, not global, and does not inherit to child notes or other each notes.

FixedSoflan writes these `Manager.NoteData` fields:

```csharp
public bool isFixedSoflanToUnifiedSpeed;
public float fixedSoflanUnifiedSpeed;
```

## MajSimai HS Boundary

Runtime does not parse MajSimai `<HS...>` commands. HS commands must be converted upstream into MA2 `SFL` rows. Conversion and chart-generation work must align:

- Generated `SFL` intervals to the intended `HSpeedInterpolationGrid`.
- Participating notes to the intended group, such as `#219`.
- Tap-family notes to FixedSoflan markers such as `#219F` or `#219F600` when the behavior must be independent of player note speed.

## Load Flow

Important runtime hooks:

1. `NotesReader.loadMa2Main()` passes `_playerID` to the per-player Soflan clear before BPM calculation.
2. `SoflanManager.clearPlayer(playerId)` removes only that player's Soflan state.
3. `SoflanManager.loadComposition()` reads `SFL`, builds the player's `BpmList`, and snapshots the same player's `UserOption.GetAdjustMSec()`.
4. `NotesReader.loadNote()` passes `_playerID` to `SoflanManager.loadNote()` before returning each note.
5. `loadNote()` registers per-player `noteIndex -> group/TGrid` and, when the marker has `F`, writes FixedSoflan fields.

If a player's chart contains no `SFL` rows, `SoflanManager.containsSoflans(playerId)` remains false and note visual patches fall back to original behavior.

## Visibility

Original visibility uses audio time and player note speed. Soflan visibility uses the current Soflan time and group-level visible-range lookup:

```csharp
currentMsec = NotesManager.GetCurrentMsec()
group = getNoteSoflanGroup(monitorId, note)
currentSoflanTime = GetCurrentSoflanTimeWithOffsetsCached(
    monitorId, currentMsec, visualAudioOffsetMsec, group)
visibleMsec = FixedSoflan.IsEnabledForNote(note) ? FixedSoflanVisibleMsec : num
checkNoteVisible(note, currentMsec, visibleMsec, group, currentSoflanTime)
```

Conceptually it maps `[currentSoflanTime, currentSoflanTime + visibleMsec]` back to one or more original audio-time ranges, then checks whether `note.time.msec` falls inside any range. This is required for stop, reverse, and bounce behavior.

The runtime converts the current clock before Soflan integration:

```text
rawCurrent = runtimeCurrent - UserOption.GetAdjustMSec() + visualAudioOffset
diff = F_group(noteRawMsec) - F_group(rawCurrent)
```

The implementation rebuilds visible ranges lazily per player/group per frame and caches current Soflan time by player, group, normalized chart offset, and visual offset.

## Soflan Y Integration

`SimpleSoflanFramework` combines BPM and Soflan speed changes into timing points. Between adjacent timing events:

```csharp
scaledLen = CalculateBPMLength(prev.TGrid, cur.TGrid, prev.Bpm.BPM) * prev.Speed
currentY += scaledLen
```

Converting audio time to Soflan Y:

1. Convert audio time to `TGrid`.
2. Find the containing Soflan segment.
3. Measure BPM length from the segment start to the target `TGrid`.
4. Multiply by segment speed.
5. Add the segment start Y.

## Visual Support Matrix

| Object or command | Normal Soflan | FixedSoflan | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MA2 `SFL` row | Supported | Not applicable | Parsed into Soflan intervals |
| BPM changes | Supported | Supported | From composition BPM list |
| `#N` marker | Supported | Not applicable | Assigns group |
| `#NF` / `#NF600` | Assigns group | Tap-family only | Patch extension |
| Tap / Break / ExTap | Supported | Supported | Y and scale are recalculated |
| Star / BreakStar / ExStar | Supported | Supported for position/scale | Rotation is not separately patched |
| Hold / BreakHold | Supported | Not supported | Head and tail use Soflan times |
| TouchNoteB / TouchNoteC | Supported | Not supported | Preserve fixed touch-area animation |
| TouchHoldC | Not covered by TouchTap logic | Not supported | Requires separate design |
| Slide | No dedicated support | Not supported | Treat as unsupported unless code changed |
| MajSimai `<HS...>` text | Not parsed directly | Not parsed directly | Convert upstream to MA2 `SFL` |

Tap-family FixedSoflan supported kinds are `Begin`, `Break`, `ExTap`, `Star`, `BreakStar`, `ExStar`, `ExBreakTap`, and `ExBreakStar`.

## Algorithms By Object Type

Tap / Break / Star:

- `NoteBase.GetNoteYPosition_soflan()` computes `diffTime = noteSoflanTime - currentSoflanTime`.
- Normal Soflan maps `diffTime` from `[moveStartTime, 0, -moveStartTime]` to `[StartPos, EndPos, outsideY]`.
- FixedSoflan uses progress from declared speed and maps `StartPos -> EndPos -> outsideY`.
- `NoteBase.NoteCheck()` and `BreakNote.NoteCheck()` recalculate scale in Soflan.

Hold / BreakHold:

- Use separate head and tail Soflan times.
- Recalculate head Y, tail Y, body length, endpoint position, and scale.
- FixedSoflan currently does not apply.

TouchNoteB / TouchNoteC:

- Do not use Tap Y-axis movement.
- Keep original semantic phases: hidden, color fade-in, gather to center, then Notice at judgment time.
- Replace only the timing axis with Soflan time.
- `TouchNoteC` inherits `TouchNoteB` display logic, so it does not need a separate patch in the current design.

## FixedSoflan Core

Default unified speed:

```csharp
DefaultUnifiedSpeed = 600f
DefaultMsec = 240000 / unifiedSpeed
```

Movement and scale timing:

```csharp
MoveStartTime = DefaultMsec - MaiBugAdjustMSec
ScaleStartTime = 2 * DefaultMsec - MaiBugAdjustMSec
VisibleMsec = DefaultMsec * 2
MotionProgress = Clamp01((MoveStartTime - diffTime) / (2 * MoveStartTime))
ScaleProgress = Clamp01((ScaleStartTime - absDiffTime) / DefaultMsec)
Y = Lerp(StartPos, EndPos + (EndPos - StartPos), MotionProgress)
```

At fixed speed `600`, `DefaultMsec = 400ms`, `MoveStartTime = 410ms`, `ScaleStartTime = 810ms`, and `VisibleMsec = 800ms`.

## Verification Anchors

- No `SFL`: original behavior.
- `speed = 1`: near-original visual behavior.
- `speed = 0`: stop without losing visibility.
- Negative speed: reverse/re-entry remains visible when appropriate.
- Multi-group: marker group affects only that note.
- Touch: fixed touch-area animation remains intact.
- Hold: head/tail and body follow Soflan time.
- FixedSoflan Tap: visual progress stays consistent across player note speeds.
